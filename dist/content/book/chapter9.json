<p>"Dad says that the wife of the first Chauffeur was a lady&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What's a lady?" Hoo-Hoo demanded.</p>
<p>"A lady 's a Chauffeur squaw," was the quick reply of Hare-Lip.</p>
<p>"The first Chauffeur was Bill, a common fellow, as I said before," the  old man expounded; "but his wife was a lady, a great lady. Before the  Scarlet Death she was the wife of Van Worden. He was President of the  Board of Industrial Magnates, and was one of the dozen men who  ruled America. He was worth one billion, eight hundred millions of  dollars&mdash;coins like you have there in your pouch, Edwin. And then came  the Scarlet Death, and his wife became the wife of Bill, the first  Chauffeur. He used to beat her, too. I have seen it myself."</p>
