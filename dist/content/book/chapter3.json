<p>I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell them what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken sentences.</p>
<p>"You'll hear more yet," I said, and went on to my home.</p>
<p>I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went into the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  The dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the table while I told my story.</p>
<p>"There is one thing," I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; "they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  They may keep the pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . . .  But the horror of them!"</p>
<p>"Don't, dear!" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine.</p>
<p>"Poor Ogilvy!" I said.  "To think he may be lying dead there!"</p>
<p>My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.  When I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.</p>
<p>"They may come here," she said again and again.</p>
<p>I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>"They can scarcely move," I said.</p>
